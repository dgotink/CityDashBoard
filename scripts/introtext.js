function getIntroText(){
    return 'This dashboard allows you, the user, to get a better view of current data (of the past 7 days) in Belgium and its cities.\n\
            These tile graphs you can see represent different datasets. If you click on one of these graphs it will expand and transmute into a line graph. \n\
            This line graph shows you the actual data that was recorded. If you hover over the line the dashboard will display the data of the datapoint the closest to your mouse location. \n\
            Each line graph exists of 2 lines: one for the actual data, the other is a trendline. You can swap the focus on the lines using the button on the top of this page.\n\
            The x axis for all of the graphs can be found on the bottom of this page, right above this small tutorial \n\
            You can manually alter the domain of the x axis using your mouse. By clicking and dragging you draw a gray rectangle that changes the graphs to only display the data from that timeframe.\n\
            Note that only a certain amount of graphs can be expanded at the same time. You can monitor this at the top left of the dashboard.\n\
            You can also change the order in which the graphs are displayed. Simply click a graph and drag it to a new location.\n\
            You can tell the dashboard to order the graphs itself by clicking one of the according buttons. \n\
            The color of the graphs will change to give a better overview of the similarity of the datasets. \n\
            To reopen this manual after closing it, press the ? button on the top right side of the dashboard.';
