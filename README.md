This repository contains the code of the CityDashboard project.

The code is divided in several files and folders.

The 'scripts' folder contains all the scripts needed for the front-end side of the Dashboard.

The 'data' folder contains a bit of dummy data. Using these files you can run the Dashboard locally which helps with development.

The index.html file is html page of the Dashboard site.
